A repository for storing simple little helper functions for the
programming assignments for the free, online Coursera Stanford
Probabilistic Graphical Modelling course.

For more info about the course, see http://class.coursera.org/pgm

Just to clarify: the functions in this repository provide features
which are tangential to the programming assignment.  i.e. these
functions don't violate the "honour code".
